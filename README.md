# UnrealEngine--GridGenerator

Grid Generation System created using blueprints in Unreal Engine v4.20.

**Tech Demo:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbaqqPjsAKE

## Grid Generator Basics:
- Use 'GridCountX' & 'GridCountY' variables in BP_GridGenerator actors to control the number of grid cells created along its local X & Y axis respectively.
- The 'GridData' array in BP_GridManager stores information about all grid generators and their corresponding grid cells. More information about individual grid cells can be added here as per requirements.
