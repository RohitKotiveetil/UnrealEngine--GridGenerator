## Grid Generator Basics:
- Use 'GridCountX' & 'GridCountY' variables in BP_GridGenerator actors to control the number of grid cells created along its local X & Y axis respectively.
- The 'GridData' array in BP_GridManager stores information about all grid generators and their corresponding grid cells. More information about individual grid cells can be added here as per requirements.
